									I am an organized, curious, and autonomous individual with a strong ability to adapt and work effectively in teams. My educational background has provided me with a solid foundation in statistical analysis, data engineering, and advanced data modeling techniques. My passion for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science drives me to constantly seek out new learning opportunities and stay updated with the latest industry trends and technological advancements. I have hands-on experience with various programming languages and tools commonly used in the field, including Python, R, SQL, and machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.
								</p>
								<p>
									Through various projects and internships, I have honed my problem-solving skills and developed a keen eye for detail, enabling me to tackle complex data challenges effectively. I thrive in dynamic environments and am eager to contribute to innovative projects that leverage data to drive meaningful insights and solutions. I am committed to continuous professional development and am actively seeking opportunities to collaborate with experts in the field, engage in cutting-edge research, and apply my skills to real-world problems. My ultimate goal is to become a leading professional in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, contributing to advancements that shape the future of technology and society.
								</p>
								<p>
									I have held data science positions in companies ranging from startups to Fortune 100 organizations. I transitioned into data science from a business and consulting background. When I was first starting out on my data science journey, I felt lost; there were very few resources available for me to learn about this field. I decided to start making YouTube videos to share my experiences and hopefully help others break into the data science and sports analytics fields.
